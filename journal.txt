*Login is working as expected:
    - Get data from the user.
    - Confirme the entered ID is in the database.
    - Opens Inventory.
*Inventory GUI set:
    - Tabs are done (Blanked) with their titles.
    - User Tab entries and label are done. Need to be better presented.
*User tab functionality:
    - Data fetch and Insert in the database succesfully.

## CHALLENGE of day(14/02/23):
    To be able to open the SecondWindow(loginGUI_1.py) from the FirstWindow(inventoryGUI_2.py) both are in different
modules. The challenge are:
    - Step 1: Check if data is the BD (the check of the data happend in another module usersBD.py. This becasue I want
        to manage the DB in separate modules for flexibility, easy to manage Class and Methods, and to reuse the code).
        To be able to create the interaction I used a callback function, this allow the script to go to the next step.

    - Step 2: Once data entered if confirmed instruct the program to open the SecondWindow that is in a different module
        to transfer the Name and ID of the logged User. The transfer of the data is important because, in the the whole
        loginGUI_1 module it will be used to register in the database the operations made by the logged User.
        **Difficulty: SecondWindow Class has parameters to fetch data but data that no exist yet, the data will be given
        by the FirstWindow.
        With out parameter SecondWindow was given error because at the moment of inisialization it will need values.
        Those wasn't there. After several tries and errors.
        ***The solution: after a while that came up to me is to use *args that takes any number of values in __init__
        and it wont requier any inmidate parameter at the moment of inisialize SecodWindow class.

* Set treeviews for billing and items tabs

Challange:
    *Learn how it work the treeview widget with scrollbar and rendering the data inside the columns.
    I started with the user tab to experiment which it was a bit confusing because I tried to do everything at the same
    time. So I took a break and went for a swimming with the dog, in the river which was pretty nice. and then started
    a new but in the billing tab to build the treeview and then to it as a blueprint and took it to Items tabs and
    modifying for items.
    **Difficulty: the most difficult it was to ask myself the right question to now what it was that I wated to achive.
    **SolUtion: plan by writting down the goal and break it down to see a better picture of what Have to do.

TODO
    # Add download button and column for image in item tab.
    #Finish Item tabs and used as a blueprint for the other tabs that I just need to refactor varaibles,values,etc. Code
    is the same. DONE for: items, supplier, clients and users.
