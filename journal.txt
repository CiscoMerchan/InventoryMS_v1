*Login is working as expected:
    - Get data from the user.
    - Confirme the entered ID is in the database.
    - Opens Inventory.
*Inventory GUI set:
    - Tabs are done (Blanked) with their titles.
    - User Tab entries and label are done. Need to be better presented.
*User tab functionality:
    - Data fetch and Insert in the database succesfully.

## CHALLENGE of day(14/02/23):
    To be able to open the SecondWindow(loginGUI_1.py) from the FirstWindow(inventoryGUI_2.py) both are in different
modules. The challenge are:
    - Step 1: Check if data is the BD (the check of the data happend in another module usersBD.py. This becasue I want
        to manage the DB in separate modules for flexibility, easy to manage Class and Methods, and to reuse the code).
        To be able to create the interaction I used a callback function, this allow the script to go to the next step.

    - Step 2: Once data entered if confirmed instruct the program to open the SecondWindow that is in a different module
        to transfer the Name and ID of the logged User. The transfer of the data is important because, in the the whole
        loginGUI_1 module it will be used to register in the database the operations made by the logged User.
        **Difficulty: SecondWindow Class has parameters to fetch data but data that no exist yet, the data will be given
        by the FirstWindow.
        With out parameter SecondWindow was given error because at the moment of inisialization it will need values.
        Those wasn't there. After several tries and errors.
        ***The solution: after a while that came up to me is to use *args that takes any number of values in __init__
        and it wont requier any inmidate parameter at the moment of inisialize SecodWindow class.
